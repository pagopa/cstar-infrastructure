<!--
   IMPORTANT:
   - Policy elements can appear only within the <inbound>, <outbound>, <backend> section elements.
   - To apply a policy to the incoming request (before it is forwarded to the backend service), place a corresponding policy element within the <inbound> section element.
   - To apply a policy to the outgoing response (before it is sent back to the caller), place a corresponding policy element within the <outbound> section element.
   - To add a policy, place the cursor at the desired insertion point and select a policy from the sidebar.
   - To remove a policy, delete the corresponding policy statement from the policy document.
   - Position the <base> element within a section element to inherit all policies from the corresponding section element in the enclosing scope.
   - Remove the <base> element to prevent inheriting policies from the corresponding section element in the enclosing scope.
   - Policies are applied in the order of their appearance, from the top down.
   - Comments within policy elements are not supported and may disappear. Place your comments between policy elements or at a higher level scope.
